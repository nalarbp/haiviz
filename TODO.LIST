#CLEANING
## Useless modules:
x dom-to-image
x file-saver
x ajv
x fs
#CHECKPOINT PER MODULE
## Dataset overview module
x change piechart to be more proportionate

## Color key module (OK)
x Change color legend/picker into scrollable list
x Change the icon to paint palette
- Add movement location into the palette

## Simulated map module (OK)
x Add switchable piechart or individual view on setting
x Add show location label checkbox on setting

## Create map app
x Fix loading xml file to create page map
x add update functionality
x fix selected node indicator
x add submit map to HAIviz app directly (error in reading back the xml object)
x add remove active/selected node button 

## Phylogenetic tree
x Add align nodes on phylotree
x Add radial layout on phylotree
x selected leaf not all branches is selected; change selected to highlighted
x change label font size (or hide it till we make it)
x scale (need to check the accuracy)
x select multiple leaf with command key (skipped: optional future feature)
- Add phylogenetic tree validation (no duplicated nodes)
~ remove tooltip (bug in the phylocanvas itself)ÃŸ

## PhyloTreeGanttChart
x Add extension line
x Add strip keys 
x Add response when selected data and color is changed
x fix indexing in bottom
x fix coloring on the gantt panel, make it identical with the ward movement module.

## Movement timeline
x Add zoom function  
x Pointer in overlapping link
- Add admission and discharge feature
- Export overlapping day to a table or show 

## Transmission graph
x Change to cytoscope.js as graph enggine
~ Fix transition between isolate and host layout on transGraph (auto detected, not necessary)
x Distinguish selected  from unselected nodes
x Click to select 
x Detect wether its host or isolates 
x host layout should shows piechart (not needed)
- bug: box selection wont work seamlesly, because cytoscape return individual event for each selected node 
  using boxend event didnt work, because it reads previous selected state, not on the end box selection
  ! potential solution is using asynchronus approach to wait and acumulate the event before sending it to 
  setSelectedData. 
  ! now, we just disable box selection feature
- multiselection using shift+click doesnt work yet

## Metadata table
x add search function
x add overflow vertical or change layout height on smaller screen
x search multiple query
- search exact match

## Temporal distribution module (OK-ish)
x Bug: selection is error: when not select any bar, it return all isolates: update selectedData only when selectedData is not empty 
x Bug: when animation selection should be made even when the box is on the middle of the chart: change > to >= and < to <= on selectionDate
x Bug: flicker when brushStart the brush area (its a tricky bug, need to be able
  to differentiate which click, which brushStart): removed brush handler
x Fix bugs on timeline (the animation not playing till the last date)
~ Fix animation bug: solution create app-level isAnimationPlaying state ?
  //not working, because the component is updated while the set interval keep running
  //on the background. Try using useRef to push all setInterval, so we can delete all
  //when pause or stop the animation
  //problem when switch between dataset while the interval still running, need to app-level isAnimationPlaying

## Menu nav
x Change main navigation menu into responsive humberger icon
- documentation route should be able to differentiate
